Doing the [cryptopals.com](https://cryptopals.com/) crypto challenges in Haskell, and trying to learn Haskell at the same time.

## Notes:

### Set 1 Parts 1 through 6:

A lot of stuff here replicates features available in Haskell modules. I preferred to write my own string process and other functions to get practice coding Haskell. There are much more sensible ways to do this stuff.

### Set 1 Parts 7:

OK, not going to write AES from scratch and I'm seeing how slow native Haskell strings can be. Time to
get a crypto library and start using Data.String.
